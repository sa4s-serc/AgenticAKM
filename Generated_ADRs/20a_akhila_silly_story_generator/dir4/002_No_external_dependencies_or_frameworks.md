# ADR-002: No external dependencies or frameworks

**Date**: 2025-10-10
**Status**: Proposed

## Context
Scope is small and functionality is straightforward.

## Decision
Implement in vanilla HTML/CSS/JS without libraries, frameworks, or build tooling.

## Consequences
Lightweight with fast load times and minimal bundle; fewer abstractions and utilities, potential for ad-hoc code growth if complexity increases.
