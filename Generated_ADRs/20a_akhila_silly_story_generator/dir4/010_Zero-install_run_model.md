**Date**: 2025-10-10
**Status**: Proposed

## Context
Reduce friction for users and learners.

## Decision
Enable running the app by simply opening index.html in a modern browser.

## Consequences
Trivial onboarding and compatible with static hosting/CDN; constrained to browser capabilities with no packaging, module system, or dev server features.
