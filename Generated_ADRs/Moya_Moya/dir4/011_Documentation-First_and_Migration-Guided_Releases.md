# ADR-011: Documentation-First and Migration-Guided Releases

**Date**: 2025-10-14
**Status**: Proposed

## Context
A widely used library must minimize upgrade friction and set clear usage patterns.

## Decision
Invest in comprehensive guides, examples, and migration documents for major versions, plus bilingual docs for broader reach.

## Consequences
Pros: Smoother adoption and upgrades, fewer support requests, shared best practices across users. Cons: Documentation and migration support increase maintenance cost and can slow major API changes.
