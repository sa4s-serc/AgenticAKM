### ADR-014: Maintain architectural documentation with PlantUML

Status: Inferred
Context: component_diagram.puml and Socrates_Platform_Component_Diagram.png are included in the repo.
Decision: Use PlantUML to document system components and their interactions.
Consequences:
- Positive: Version-controlled, text-based diagrams; easy to keep close to code; facilitates knowledge sharing.
- Negative: Requires team familiarity with PlantUML; diagrams can drift if not regularly updated.
