# ADR-003: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui (Radix) for UI

**Date**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: Proposed

## Context
Rapid UI assembly and consistent design were needed for many screens and components.

## Decision
Adopt Tailwind for utility-first styling and shadcn/ui built on Radix primitives for accessible, copy-in components.

## Consequences
Accelerated UI development and accessible primitives; copied components require manual updates over time; potential bundle size growth and design drift if not curated.
