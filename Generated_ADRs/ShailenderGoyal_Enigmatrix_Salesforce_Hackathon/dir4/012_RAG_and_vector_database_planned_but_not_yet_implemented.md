# ADR-012: RAG and vector database planned but not yet implemented

**Date**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: Proposed

## Context
The README describes RAG-enabled architecture and vector storage as part of the vision.

## Decision
Defer RAG implementation while designing APIs to accommodate retrieval-augmented responses later.

## Consequences
Shorter time-to-value and reduced complexity now; later integration will require embedding pipelines, chunking, and index management; API contracts should remain adaptable.
