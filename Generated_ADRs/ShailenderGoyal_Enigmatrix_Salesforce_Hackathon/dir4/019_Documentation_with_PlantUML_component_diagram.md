# ADR-019: Documentation with PlantUML component diagram

**Date**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: Proposed

## Context
component_diagram.puml and a generated PNG provide an architecture view.

## Decision
Maintain an explicit component diagram as a living artifact alongside code.

## Consequences
Improves shared understanding and onboarding; requires disciplined updates to stay accurate; can guide future refactors (e.g., adding RAG/vector services).
