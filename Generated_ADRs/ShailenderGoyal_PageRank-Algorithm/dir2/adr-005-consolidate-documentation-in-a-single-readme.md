### ADR-005: Consolidate documentation in a single README

**Status:** Inferred
**Context:** A README.md is present and no other documentation structure (docs/ directory, Sphinx/MkDocs config) is visible.
**Decision:** Use README.md as the primary source of project documentation.
**Consequences:** 
- Positive: Centralized, easy-to-find guidance; minimal overhead.
- Negative: Limited scalability for extensive docs; harder to maintain structured or versioned documentation as the project grows.
