# ADR-004: Documentation centralized in README

**Date**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: Proposed

## Context
README.md is the only documented source of purpose, usage, and inputs/outputs.

## Decision
Provide all user-facing documentation in a single README file without separate API docs or a documentation site.

## Consequences
Easy discoverability and minimal maintenance, but limited depth, risk of drift from code behavior, and lack of reference documentation for programmatic use.
