# ADR-005: No automated testing or CI

**Date**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: Proposed

## Context
The repository includes no tests or CI configuration.

## Decision
Proceed without a test suite, continuous integration, or quality gates.

## Consequences
Faster initial development and simpler repo, but higher risk of regressions, manual verification burden, and impeded refactoring confidence.
