# ADR-013: No CI/CD, tests, or code quality automation

**Date**: 2025-10-14
**Status**: Proposed

## Context
No evidence of unit tests, style/type checks, or CI pipelines is present.

## Decision
Defer automated testing, linting, and continuous integration for the project.

## Consequences
Accelerates initial prototyping, but elevates the risk of regressions, reduces maintainability, and impedes adoption in production-grade environments.
