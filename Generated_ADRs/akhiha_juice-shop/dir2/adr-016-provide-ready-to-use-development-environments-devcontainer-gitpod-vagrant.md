### ADR-016: Provide ready-to-use development environments (DevContainer, Gitpod, Vagrant)

Status: Inferred
Context: .devcontainer.json, .gitpod.yml, and vagrant/ are present.
Decision: Offer multiple standardized development environments to reduce setup friction.
Consequences:
- Positive: Faster onboarding; reproducible dev setups; supports contributor diversity.
- Negative: Extra maintenance effort to keep environments consistent with project changes.
