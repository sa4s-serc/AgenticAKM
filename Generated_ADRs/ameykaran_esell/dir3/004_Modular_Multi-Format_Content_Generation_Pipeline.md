# ADR-004: Modular, Multi-Format Content Generation Pipeline

**Date**: 2025-10-14
**Status**: Proposed

## Context
The system must convert a single source document into multiple, distinct output formats (infographics, videos, posters, chat). A single, monolithic generation process would be difficult to maintain, debug, and extend with new formats.

## Decision
A modular, pipeline-based approach was implemented on the backend. Each output format is generated by a distinct, specialized sub-system (e.g., a dedicated `/video` module), which is orchestrated by the main application.

## Consequences
This modularity makes the system highly extensible; new output formats can be added with minimal impact on existing ones. It also improves fault isolation, as a failure in one pipeline (e.g., video rendering) doesn't necessarily prevent others (e.g., poster generation) from succeeding. The drawback is increased complexity in the orchestration logic required to manage the different pipelines and their intermediate data artifacts.
