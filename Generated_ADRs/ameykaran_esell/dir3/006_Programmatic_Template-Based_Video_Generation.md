# ADR-006: Programmatic, Template-Based Video Generation

**Date**: 2025-10-14
**Status**: Proposed

## Context
One of the key deliverables is the automatic creation of short-form videos (reels) from academic content. This process must be fully automated and scalable, without requiring any manual video editing.

## Decision
A custom, script-based video rendering pipeline was created. This system programmatically assembles videos using a scene-based templating system, where the script and content for each scene are generated by the LLM.

## Consequences
This approach enables the fully automated and scalable production of videos with a consistent style, a key feature of the platform. However, the creative flexibility of the output is constrained by the predefined templates. Furthermore, video rendering is computationally intensive, which can lead to significant processing times and high server costs.
