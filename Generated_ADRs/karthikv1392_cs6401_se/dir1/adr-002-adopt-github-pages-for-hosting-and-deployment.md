### ADR-002: Adopt GitHub Pages for Hosting and Deployment

**Status:** Inferred
**Context:** A hosting solution is needed for the static website generated by Jekyll. The ideal solution should be cost-effective (preferably free), reliable, and tightly integrated with the development workflow, which is likely based on Git. The project needs to ensure that the local development environment matches the production environment to avoid deployment issues.
**Decision:** The website will be hosted and deployed using GitHub Pages. This decision is strongly supported by the inclusion of the `gem 'github-pages'` in the `Gemfile`. This gem bundles all the Jekyll plugins and dependencies that GitHub Pages uses, allowing developers to perfectly replicate the production build environment locally. The deployment process is simplified to a `git push` to a specific branch in the GitHub repository.
**Consequences:**
*   **Positive:**
    *   **Zero-Cost Hosting:** GitHub Pages offers free hosting for public repositories, which is perfect for a course website.
    *   **Integrated CI/CD:** The deployment pipeline is built-in. Pushing to the designated branch automatically triggers a Jekyll build and deploys the resulting site.
    *   **Managed Infrastructure:** No server maintenance, patching, or configuration is required from the development team.
    *   **High Availability:** The service is managed by GitHub, providing excellent reliability and uptime.
*   **Negative:**
    *   **Limited Customization:** The project is restricted to the Jekyll plugins and versions supported by the `github-pages` gem.
    *   **Public Source Code:** To qualify for free hosting, the underlying Git repository must be public, which is acceptable for this use case but not for proprietary projects.
