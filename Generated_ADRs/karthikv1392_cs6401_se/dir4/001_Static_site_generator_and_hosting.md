# ADR-001: Static site generator and hosting

**Date**: 2025-10-08
**Status**: Proposed

## Context
The repo contains _config.yml, standard Jekyll structures, and targets a course website.

## Decision
Use Jekyll with GitHub Pages as the static site generator and hosting platform.

## Consequences
Minimal operations and easy publishing with built-in GitHub Pages support, but limited to the GitHub Pages plugin whitelist and static-only capabilities; dynamic features require external services.
