# ADR-006: Custom layouts, includes, and SASS theming

**Date**: 2025-10-08
**Status**: Proposed

## Context
Custom layouts exist under _layouts, includes under _includes, and styles in _sass/custom.

## Decision
Implement bespoke theming and structure using Liquid layouts/includes and SCSS partials.

## Consequences
Enables consistent branding and reusable page structures; contributors need HTML/Liquid/SCSS skills; styling is tied to the Jekyll build pipeline.
