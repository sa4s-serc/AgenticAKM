# ADR-010: Multiple home-like top-level pages

**Date**: 2025-10-08
**Status**: Proposed

## Context
Both index.md and home.md exist at the top level.

## Decision
Maintain more than one top-level landing page file.

## Consequences
Potential for routing ambiguity, duplicated content, or contributor confusion; should consolidate to a single canonical entry point to reduce drift.
