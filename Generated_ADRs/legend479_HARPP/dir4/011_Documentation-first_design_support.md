# ADR-011: Documentation-first design support

**Date**: 2025-10-13
**Status**: Proposed

## Context
The repo includes a design document, class and sequence diagrams, and activity diagrams alongside the code.

## Decision
Invest in formal design documentation and UML artifacts to describe architecture and key flows.

## Consequences
Aids onboarding, communication, and alignment on design intent; documentation may drift from the implementation over time and requires ongoing maintenance to remain authoritative.
