### ADR-010: Document architecture with PlantUML diagrams

Status: Inferred
Context: metamodel-saml.puml and llmbased/seq.puml with an exported seq.svg.
Decision: Use PlantUML to capture and version architectural models and sequence flows.
Consequences:
- Positive: Clear, version-controlled diagrams; easy regeneration and review.
- Negative: Requires keeping diagrams in sync with code; additional tooling to render.
