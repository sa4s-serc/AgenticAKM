### ADR-012: Track compatibility notes and workarounds for PyDEVS and Python versions

Status: Inferred
Context: llmbased/NOTES/pyDEVS-3.11-Fix and related notes suggest version-specific issues.
Decision: Maintain internal notes and patches/workarounds to ensure PyDEVS runs on target Python versions (e.g., 3.11).
Consequences:
- Positive: Clear operational guidance; reduced friction for contributors.
- Negative: Ongoing maintenance burden; potential divergence from upstream packages.
