# ADR-011: Documentation via UML artifacts and recorded sequences

**Date**: 2025-10-09
**Status**: Proposed

## Context
Communicating metamodel structure and pipeline behavior is necessary for contributors and evaluators.

## Decision
Maintain PlantUML metamodel (metamodel-saml.puml) and sequence diagrams (seq.puml) alongside code.

## Consequences
Enhances onboarding and design clarity; requires discipline to keep diagrams in sync; supports design reviews and future refactoring.
