### ADR-005: Use Markdown for project documentation

**Status:** Inferred
**Context:** A README.md is present, which commonly serves as the primary documentation entry point.
**Decision:** Document the project using a Markdown README.
**Consequences:** 
- Positive: Readable on code hosting platforms, easy to maintain, low barrier for contributors.
- Negative: Limited structure for large documentation sets, lacks advanced features provided by dedicated docs generators (e.g., Sphinx, MkDocs) unless expanded later.
