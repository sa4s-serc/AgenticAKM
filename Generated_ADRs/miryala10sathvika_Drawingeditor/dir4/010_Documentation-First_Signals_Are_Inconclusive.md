# ADR-010: Documentation-First Signals Are Inconclusive

**Date**: 2025-10-13
**Status**: Proposed

## Context
README.md exists but its contents are unknown; top-level indicators for setup/usage are absent.

## Decision
Depend on ad-hoc README content (if any) rather than explicit, structured documentation of setup, usage, and architecture.

## Consequences
Potential gaps in onboarding and operations knowledge, duplicated tribal knowledge, and higher support burden for maintainers.
