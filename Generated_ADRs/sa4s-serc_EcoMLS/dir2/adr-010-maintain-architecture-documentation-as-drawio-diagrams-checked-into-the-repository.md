### ADR-010: Maintain architecture documentation as draw.io diagrams checked into the repository

Status: Inferred
Context: EcoMLS_Architecture_Diagram.drawio.png and draw.io PDFs under Results.
Decision: Use draw.io diagrams for architectural documentation and include them in the repository.
Consequences:
- Positive: Visual clarity for stakeholders; versioned alongside code; aids onboarding.
- Negative: Diagrams can drift from implementation if not maintained; changes require manual updates.
