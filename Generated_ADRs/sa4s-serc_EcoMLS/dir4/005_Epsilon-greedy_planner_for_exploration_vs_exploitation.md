# ADR-005: Epsilon-greedy planner for exploration vs exploitation

**Date**: 2025-10-10
**Status**: Proposed

## Context
Selecting a model must balance learning about alternatives and exploiting the current best option under an energy-confidence objective.

## Decision
Use an epsilon-greedy policy with a configurable exploration rate to select among model variants based on a composite score.

## Consequences
Low-complexity, robust behavior with minimal compute overhead. May converge slowly or be suboptimal compared to contextual bandits or Bayesian methods and requires tuning epsilon to workload dynamics.
