# ADR-004: Integration of an Interactive In-Browser REPL

**Date**: 2025-10-11
**Status**: Proposed

## Context
For an unfamiliar esoteric language, lowering the barrier to entry is critical for user adoption and learning. A static description of the language is far less effective than a hands-on, interactive experience.

## Decision
An interactive Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL) component was developed and embedded directly within the documentation website. This allows users to write and execute 'WhyPy' code in the browser.

## Consequences
This feature transforms the documentation from a passive resource into an active learning tool. It significantly improves the user experience, encouraging experimentation and deeper engagement with the language without requiring any local installation or setup.
