# ADR-006: Thematic and Esoteric Language Design

**Date**: 2025-10-11
**Status**: Proposed

## Context
The project's objective was to create a unique, 'esoteric' language, not a general-purpose one. The language's syntax and keywords needed to reflect a distinct identity and character.

## Decision
A thematic vocabulary was chosen for all language constructs, replacing standard keywords and operators with unique terms like `manifest` (let), `whence` (if), and `augments` (+). This was reinforced with a matching 'mystical' visual theme for the website.

## Consequences
This is the core product decision that defines the project's identity. It successfully establishes the language as esoteric and memorable, creating a cohesive and engaging user experience. While sacrificing practical utility, it fully achieves its artistic and educational goals.
