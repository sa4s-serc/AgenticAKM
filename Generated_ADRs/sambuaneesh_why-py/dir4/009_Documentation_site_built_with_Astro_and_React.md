# ADR-009: Documentation site built with Astro and React

**Date**: 2025-10-11
**Status**: Proposed

## Context
Educational materials and examples should be accessible and modern.

## Decision
Adopt an Astro-based static site with React components (InteractiveRepl.jsx) and TypeScript tooling.

## Consequences
Delivers a fast, modern docs experience and supports interactive components; introduces a JavaScript/Node toolchain and build complexity alongside the Python stack.
