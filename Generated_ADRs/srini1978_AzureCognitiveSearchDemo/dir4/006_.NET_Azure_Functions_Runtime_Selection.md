# ADR-006: .NET Azure Functions Runtime Selection

**Date**: 2025-10-09
**Status**: Proposed

## Context
Project is a C# Azure Functions app with FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME=dotnet in local.settings.json.

## Decision
Build the custom skill in .NET on Azure Functions.

## Consequences
Leverages mature tooling and strong typing for payload handling and HTTP calls; ties runtime behavior to the chosen Functions version and .NET lifecycle, requiring periodic upgrades and attention to cold start/performance tuning.
