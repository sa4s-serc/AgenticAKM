# ADR-012: Documentation-driven development with ADRs, UML, and benchmarks

**Date**: 2025-10-14
**Status**: Proposed

## Context
Maintaining architectural clarity and traceability is important for evolving a modular system and aligning contributors.

## Decision
Include ADRs capturing key choices, UML diagrams of patterns, and benchmarking artifacts to justify design trade-offs (e.g., modular vs monolith).

## Consequences
Improves onboarding, rationale traceability, and design consistency; requires upkeep to prevent drift; encourages deliberate change management.
