# ADR-007: Windows-oriented setup and networking helpers

**Date**: 2025-10-14
**Status**: Proposed

## Context
Local developer experience and quick starts are prioritized.

## Decision
Include .bat scripts for setup, CUDA install, dependency installation, and firewall configuration.

## Consequences
Lowers onboarding friction on Windows; may under-serve Linux/macOS automation; firewall changes can introduce security risks if misapplied.
